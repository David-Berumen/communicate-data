# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis
## by David Berumen


## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction/version/2 it containes around 130000 surveys made to passengers of an US airline. The survey includes the overall satisfaction, age, gender, flight distance and other additional information.

## Summary of Findings

The main finding is that the class where the passenger travels has a high impact on the final overall satisfaction, there are additional factors that also impact and one of them is the inflight wifi service.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I am gonna start by looking at the overall satisfaction results, then exploring by class and finally explaining some of the additional factors that impact overall satisfaction.
